In the Global Superstore Sales BI project, I began by importing and ensuring the cleanliness of the dataset. The integration of essential DAX measures and calculated columns enhanced the analytical capabilities. Through establishing relationships among the "orders," "people," and "return" tables, a robust foundation for analysis was laid.

The dashboard created as a result offers a comprehensive sales analysis of Global Superstore's operations. Key Performance Indicators (KPI) cards display crucial metrics like total sales, total quantity, average delivery days, and return orders. Visualizations include pie charts illustrating sales distribution across different segments and markets, as well as a bar chart showcasing the top 10 customers and the most profitable and loss-incurring products.

An integral component is the dynamic map, depicting sales geographically through varying bubble sizes. The thoughtful arrangement of these elements provides a holistic view of sales patterns, customer behaviors, and product performance.

This dashboard equips decision-makers with the insights needed to understand sales trends, customer preferences, and areas for potential enhancement. By leveraging this data-driven approach, businesses can optimize sales strategies, improve customer experiences, and ultimately enhance overall profitability within the Global Superstore Sales context.
